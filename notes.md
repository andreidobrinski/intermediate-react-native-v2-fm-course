Deep linking

```
npx uri-scheme open plantly://plants/1 --ios
```

- opens to /plants/1
- can pass params with custom actions into deep links
- [deep linking docs](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/deep-linking/)

## EAS

- passing a `--local` flag means that it runs the build locally on your machine
- it doesn't cost anything, since EAS charges for cloud builds

## Deploying to stores

- need a developer account
- can be a indiviudal or business account. Need to prove ownership of the business if it's a business acount
- need to display full address registered to your account if the app is monetized
